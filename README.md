# Word2Mat
Hi! This is an NLP research project. I'm trying to find an alterative way to represent word meanings in a computer - one which could elegantly be extended to produce meanings of phrases while taking word order into account.

I don't have a lot of computing resources, so I'm using a toy dataset of [Toki Pona](http://tokipona.org/) text. This language only has 120(ish) words which never change form, so it should be much easier to handle computationally.
