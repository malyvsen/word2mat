test:
repeat 10,000 times:
	initialize 20 matrices with different initialization and multiply them.
	Plot disribution of all values together in histogram


Hypothesis:
Unifrm and Gaussian will cause large skewed distributions
cosine init solves this


Results:
All distributions end up with a fat tail after a few iteration. The fat tail becomes worse and worse with every iteration

When taking the square root after every iteration, the distribution converges to a stable one (remains the same after more multiplications)
