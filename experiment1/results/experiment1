test:
repeat 10,000 times:
	initialize 20 matrices with different initialization and multiply them.
	Plot disribution of all values together in histogram


Hypothesis:
Unifrm and Gaussian will cause large skewed distributions
cosine init solves this


Results:
Uniform distribution gives skewed results
Results for Gaussian and cosine are almost identical:
	- resulting distribution is Guassian (no skew)
	- standard deviation decreases after more multiplications
	
	
Comments on scale:	
The values of the resulting distribution can exlpode or shrink according to the mean of the initialization. More research is needed on this. The correlation with eigenvalues is not directly clear. Even when the initialised matrices have eigenvalues with avg < 1, the values still explode. There is a relation however: small enough initialization mean will lead to values shrinking. => more research to find out the 'sweet spot' where values remain constant. This happens for both cosine as gaussian inits.
